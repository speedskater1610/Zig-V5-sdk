# Vex V5  SDK written in Zig

Zig bindings to vex SDKs and interacting with VEXos system APIs. These are going to be used to create a high level library in Zig for interacting with components on the vex V5 brain. Thank you for all of the inspiration and documentation [vexide](https://github.com/vexide/vex-sdk/tree/main).
